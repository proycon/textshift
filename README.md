# TextShift

A command-line gadget to let text emerge from noise. Not very useful but just for fun :)

The tool reads text from standard input.


## Examples

```
$ echo "Hello world" | textshift
```
Using blocks as vocabulary looks quite nice:
```
$ echo "Hello world" | textshift --vocabulary "▁▂▃▄▆▅▇▊▋▌▏▖▗▘▙▚▜▝▟"

```
